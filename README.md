## Introduction to the Lossless Pipeline

This EEG processing pipeline is especially useful for the following scenarios:

- You want to keep your EEG data in a continuous state, allowing you the flexibility to
  epoch your data at a later stage.
- You are part of a research team or community that shares a common dataset, and you
  want to process the data once in a way that can be used for multiple analyses (i.e.,
  one analysis can segment the cleaned data into 10-second epochs and filter the data
  betweeen 1-30Hz, while another analysis can use 1-second epochs with no filter, etc.)
- You want to be able to do a hands on review of the pre-processing results for each file.

Please find the full documentation at
[**pylossless.readthedocs.io**](https://pylossless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

**NOTE**: This documentation refers to the original implementation and may have some slight differences compared to this fork. For now, issues can be opened here on GitHub if things appear to be incorrect/broken.

### Fork Description

This fork is maintained as a lightweight HPC-ready version of the original implementation.

## üìò Installation and usage instructions

To begin using the latest version, it is recommended to create a new virtual environment to install the package in. Assuming you have done so, proceed as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andesha/pylossless.git
pip install ./pylossless
```

### Running a simple build test

If you are unsure if the pipeline has been set up correctly, you can run a simple test via the CLI from where you did the `pip install` via:
```bash
pytest -W ignore pylossless/tests/test_eeg_metrics.py::test_pipeline_running
```

If this passes, you can assume the pipeline is working and ready to go! If not, please open an issue on the issue tracker.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the pyLossless Pipeline
Below is a minimal example that runs the pipeline one of MNE's sample files. This example will return a warning that the sampling rate of the data is too low for ICLabel. This is an expected property of the sample data.

```python
import pylossless as ll 
import mne
fname = mne.datasets.sample.data_path() / 'MEG' / 'sample' /  'sample_audvis_raw.fif'
raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(fname, preload=True).pick('eeg')

config = ll.config.Config()
config.load_default()

pipeline = ll.LosslessPipeline(config=config)
pipeline.run_with_raw(raw)
```

Once it is completed, You can see what channels and times were flagged:
```python
print(pipeline.flags['ch'])
print(pipeline.flags['ic'])
print(pipeline.flags['epoch'])
```

To get a **cleaned** version, you can use a `RejectionPolicy` object to apply
these annotations to your raw object. This is a lossy operation:
```python
rejection_policy = ll.RejectionPolicy()
cleaned_raw = rejection_policy.apply(pipeline)
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example HPC Environment Setup

If you are a Canadian researcher working on an HPC system such as [Narval](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Narval/en):

```bash
# Build the virtualenv in your homedir
virtualenv --no-download eeg-env
source eeg-env/bin/activate

pip install --no-index mne
pip install --no-index pandas
pip install --no-index xarray
pip install --no-index pyyaml
pip install --no-index sklearn
pip install mne_bids

# Clone down mne-iclabel and switch to the right version and install it locally
git clone https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-icalabel.git
cd mne-icalabel
git checkout maint/0.4
pip install .

# Clone down pipeline and install without reading dependencies
git clone git@github.com:lina-usc/pylossless.git
cd pylossless
pip install --no-deps .

# Verify that the package has installed correct with an import
python -c 'import pylossless'
```
