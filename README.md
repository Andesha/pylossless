## Introduction to the Lossless Pipeline

This EEG processing pipeline is especially useful for the following scenarios:

- You want to keep your EEG data in a continuous state, allowing you the flexibility to
  epoch your data at a later stage.
- You are part of a research team or community that shares a common dataset, and you
  want to process the data once in a way that can be used for multiple analyses (i.e.,
  one analysis can segment the cleaned data into 10-second epochs and filter the data
  betweeen 1-30Hz, while another analysis can use 1-second epochs with no filter, etc.)
- You want to be able to do a hands on review of the pre-processing results for each file.

Please find the full documentation at
[**pylossless.readthedocs.io**](https://pylossless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

**NOTE**: This documentation refers to the original implementation and may have some slight differences compared to this fork. For now, issues can be opened here on GitHub if things appear to be incorrect/broken.

### Fork Description

This fork is maintained as a lightweight HPC-ready version of the original implementation.

All credit to the original Authors and their repository [here](https://github.com/lina-usc/pylossless).


## üìò Installation and usage instructions

To begin using the latest version, it is recommended to create a new virtual environment to install the package in. Assuming you have done so, proceed as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andesha/pylossless.git
pip install ./pylossless
```

### Installing the Quality Control dependencies

This package also of course supports expert review via a Quality Control (QC) process.

To install the package so that QCing is possible do the following at install time:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andesha/pylossless.git
pip install ./pylossless[qc]
```

NOTE: This can also be done after installing just the basic version as above.

### Running a simple build test

If you are unsure if the pipeline has been set up correctly, you can run a simple test via the CLI from within the pylossless folder via:
```bash
pytest -W ignore tests/test_eeg_metrics.py::test_pipeline_running
```

If this passes, you can assume the pipeline is working and ready to go! If not, please open an issue on the issue tracker.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the pyLossless Pipeline
Below is a minimal example that runs the pipeline one of MNE's sample files. This example will return a warning that the sampling rate of the data is too low for ICLabel. This is an expected property of the sample data.

```python
import pylossless as ll 
import mne
fname = mne.datasets.sample.data_path() / 'MEG' / 'sample' /  'sample_audvis_raw.fif'
raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(fname, preload=True).pick('eeg')

config = ll.config.Config()
config.load_default()

pipeline = ll.LosslessPipeline(config=config)
pipeline.run_with_raw(raw)
```

Once it is completed, You can see what channels and times were flagged:
```python
print(pipeline.flags['ch'])
print(pipeline.flags['ic'])
print(pipeline.flags['epoch'])
```

Saving the pipeline can be done as a BIDS derivative if you are working within that structure, or more simply, you can forcibly save the subject at any given directory level via:

```python
pipeline.non_bids_save('1', '.', overwrite=True)
```

This example will save the subject as "sub-1" and create a new derivatives folder at `'.'`, meaning the current working directory.

To get a **cleaned** version, you can use a `RejectionPolicy` object to apply
these annotations to your raw object. This is a lossy operation:
```python
rejection_policy = ll.RejectionPolicy()
cleaned_raw = rejection_policy.apply(pipeline)
```

### Launching the Quality Control procedure

The following example will launch the beta version of QCing from this fork. Replace the path to the sample with your own file.

Components can be clicked on the topo plot to zoom in, and when rejecting components from the scroll plot, the effect on the scalp data will be illustrated.

```python
pipeline = ll.LosslessPipeline()
pipeline = pipeline.load_ll_derivative('derivatives/pylossless/sub-1/eeg/sub-1_task-pyl_eeg.edf')

rejection_policy = ll.RejectionPolicy()
review = ll.QC(pipeline, rejection_policy)
review.run()
cleaned_raw = review.apply_qc()
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example HPC Environment Setup

If you are a Canadian researcher working on an HPC system such as [Narval](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Narval/en):

```bash
# Build the virtualenv in your homedir
virtualenv --no-download eeg-env
source eeg-env/bin/activate

pip install --no-index mne
pip install --no-index pandas
pip install --no-index xarray
pip install --no-index pyyaml
pip install --no-index sklearn
pip install mne_bids

# Clone down mne-iclabel and switch to the right version and install it locally
git clone https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-icalabel.git
cd mne-icalabel
git checkout maint/0.4
pip install .

# Clone down pipeline and install without reading dependencies
git clone git@github.com:lina-usc/pylossless.git
cd pylossless
pip install --no-deps .

# Verify that the package has installed correct with an import
python -c 'import pylossless'
```
