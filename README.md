## Introduction to the Lossless Pipeline

The pyLossless pre-processing pipeline focuses on isolation of cortical signals from noise while retaining maximal information from the raw EEG data. The pipeline‚Äôs goal is to ensure minimal data manipulation and enhance signal quality annotations. This provides researchers with a scalable solution for handling large datasets across multiple EEG recording conditions. Particular attention has also been given to making the package easy to run for researchers just beginning their journey into working with large datasets in a High Performance Computing (HPC) environment.

### Critical assumptions of the pipeline's approach

The following are the theoretical assumptions and foundations:

* Independent component analysis (ICA) for removal of artifacts is extremely effective at cleaning data
* ICA algorithms fall appart when there is non-stationarity (wild variance) in the data
* The pipeline should seek to eliminate these times/sources to improve ICA outcomes
* Raw voltage values does not tell the complete story of an artifact
* Examining distributions of the variances of voltages within small windows allows for rejection of bad sources or time

The following are implementation requirements of the pipeline that meets the above assumptions:

* Expert manual review is important and must be possible
* Researcher must be able to free to manipulate their data before and after the pipeline easily
* The pipeline must be able to be effective on large datasets effectively

### Pipeline stages

The key stages of the pipeline include:

1. Special average reference calculation for leaving out comically bad channels
2. Rejection of bad channels followed by rejection of bad time
3. High and low pass filtering
4. Bridged channel rejection (and rejection of channels that are too unlike their neighbours) as well as rank channel
5. Compute first ICA
6. Rejection of time where ICA failed to decompose signal into minimal number of components
7. Second pass of ICA
8. Post processing and classication of components using ICLabel

For a formal breakdown of each step, please see the documentation.

### Output state

Users may choose to export data from the pipeline in any way they see fit. This includes BIDS, MNE's fif raw objects, EEGLAB files, or just cleaned EDFs.

## Documentation
 
Please find the full documentation at
[**pylossless.readthedocs.io**](https://pylossless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

**NOTE**: This documentation refers to the original implementation and may have some slight differences compared to this fork. For now, issues can be opened here on GitHub if things appear to be incorrect/broken.

## Fork Description

This fork is maintained as a lightweight HPC-ready version of the original implementation.

## üìò Installation and usage instructions

To begin using the latest version, it is recommended to create a new virtual environment to install the package in. Assuming you have done so, proceed as follows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andesha/pylossless.git
pip install ./pylossless
```

### Installing the Quality Control dependencies

This package also of course supports expert review via a Quality Control (QC) process.

To install the package so that QCing is possible do the following at install time:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andesha/pylossless.git
pip install ./pylossless[qc]
```

NOTE: This can also be done after installing just the basic version as above.

### Running a simple build test

If you are unsure if the pipeline has been set up correctly, you can run a simple test via the CLI from within the pylossless folder via:
```bash
pytest -W ignore tests/test_eeg_metrics.py::test_pipeline_running
```

If this passes, you can assume the pipeline is working and ready to go! If not, please open an issue on the issue tracker.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the pyLossless Pipeline
Below is a minimal example that runs the pipeline one of MNE's sample files. This example will return a warning that the sampling rate of the data is too low for ICLabel. This is an expected property of the sample data.

```python
import pylossless as ll 
import mne
fname = mne.datasets.sample.data_path() / 'MEG' / 'sample' /  'sample_audvis_raw.fif'
raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(fname, preload=True).pick('eeg')

config = ll.config.Config()
config.load_default()

pipeline = ll.LosslessPipeline(config=config)
pipeline.run_with_raw(raw)
```

Once it is completed, You can see what channels and times were flagged:
```python
print(pipeline.flags['ch'])
print(pipeline.flags['ic'])
print(pipeline.flags['epoch'])
```

Saving the pipeline can be done as a BIDS derivative if you are working within that structure, or more simply, you can forcibly save the subject at any given directory level via:

```python
pipeline.non_bids_save('1', '.', overwrite=True)
```

This example will save the subject as "sub-1" and create a new derivatives folder at `'.'`, meaning the current working directory.

To get a **cleaned** version, you can use a `RejectionPolicy` object to apply
these annotations to your raw object. This is a lossy operation:
```python
rejection_policy = ll.RejectionPolicy()
cleaned_raw = rejection_policy.apply(pipeline)
```

### Launching the Quality Control procedure

The following example will launch the beta version of QCing from this fork. Replace the path to the sample with your own file.

Components can be clicked on the topo plot to zoom in, and when rejecting components from the scroll plot, the effect on the scalp data will be illustrated.

```python
pipeline = ll.LosslessPipeline()
pipeline = pipeline.load_ll_derivative('derivatives/pylossless/sub-1/eeg/sub-1_task-pyl_eeg.edf')

rejection_policy = ll.RejectionPolicy()
review = ll.QC(pipeline, rejection_policy)
review.run()
cleaned_raw = review.apply_qc()
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Example HPC Environment Setup

If you are a Canadian researcher working on an HPC system such as [Narval](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Narval/en):

**NOTE**: This is currently out of date. Copy and paste at your own risk.

```bash
# Build the virtualenv in your homedir
virtualenv --no-download eeg-env
source eeg-env/bin/activate

pip install --no-index mne
pip install --no-index pandas
pip install --no-index xarray
pip install --no-index pyyaml
pip install --no-index sklearn
pip install mne_bids

# Clone down mne-iclabel and switch to the right version and install it locally
git clone https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-icalabel.git
cd mne-icalabel
git checkout maint/0.4
pip install .

# Clone down pipeline and install without reading dependencies
git clone git@github.com:lina-usc/pylossless.git
cd pylossless
pip install --no-deps .

# Verify that the package has installed correct with an import
python -c 'import pylossless'
```
